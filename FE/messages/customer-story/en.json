  "testimq_1": "Sabrina, can you tell us about your activity?",
  "testima_1": "My name is Sabrina, I have been an entrepreneur for 7 years. I retook the family shop “Lalylook boutique” where I work with my mother. Our company used to be opened only 6 months a year due to saisonality as our shop is on sea side",
  "testimq_2": "When and why did you start doing Facebook lives?",
  "testima_2": "Things were getting tougher and tougher each year. We were looking for a side income and started doing Facebook lives in April 2019.",
  "testimq_3": "How was the beginning?",
  "testima_3": "In winter 2019 / early 2020, the pandemic and lock-down made our business skyrocket. Our clients, and people in general quickly adopted new buying habits. Even after the lockdown was over, we still could maintain our rhythm. But eventually you only have 7 days a week and 24h a day.",
  "testimq_4": "What happened?",
  "testima_4": "We realized that all the small process accumulation was time-consuming. I had very little time to rest, see my friends or take care of my family. I was exhausted.",
  "testimq_5": "How did you got to that point?",
  "testima_5": "Well, we had no dedicated software nor any computer knowledge… So we started looking for a simple and intuitive solution that would fit our need and activity. And this is when we discovered Live Pro Shop. To be honest, I was skeptical at first, but, upon insistence from my mother, still accepted to give it a try.",
  "testimq_6": "How did the experience go?",
  "testima_6": "We have been using Live Pro Shop for a few months now. I was amazed by the changes it provided : - Signing up is simple - No more time wasted making modifications, generating invoices or follow-ups - I sell much more - I keep selling even when I am not on camera - The saved time was invested in tying bonds with my community and working on social media The more money I make, the more articles I can buy and thus obtain better prices from my providers. That means best prices for my clients. And happy clients are the key to a successful business. It has been a game changer."
